# About PSSD

This page is the home of the puget sound speech and debate society. The purpose of this 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization is to educate middle and high school students in areas of critical thinking, rhetoric, logical argumentation, research through valid sources, communication, and presentation skills through participation in school debate clubs and tournaments. Additionally, this mission includes the goal of making debate as accessible as possible to students from all backgrounds. It is our belief that any student with the desire to participate in debate deserves the chance to do so.
